# Open Disclosure California

This is the front-end AngularJS application for viewing ballot measure funding data. This front-end application works from an API defined by the [back-end Django application](https://github.com/caciviclab/disclosure-backend)


## Contributing

### Tests

Don't forget to run the tests.

    $ npm test


### Where does the data come from?

The data comes from the [disclosure API][disclosure-api]. The
API is incomplete, but the
[repo][disclosure-backend] has useful information
about what the models are shaping up like, even for incomplete APIs. [Ballot models](https://github.com/caciviclab/disclosure-backend/blob/master/ballot/models.py)
are separate from [finance data](https://github.com/caciviclab/disclosure-backend/blob/master/netfile/models.py),
since that's how the data is ingested, but eventually should be combined for the
frontend views.

#### Testing against a development backend

If you want to test against a development backend, you can set these environment
variables

    $ DISCLOSURE_STATIC_BACKEND='http://localhost:4567' DISCLOSURE_SWAGGER_SPEC='http://localhost:8000/docs/api-docs/' npm start

And the tests

    $ DISCLOSURE_STATIC_BACKEND='http://localhost:4567' DISCLOSURE_SWAGGER_SPEC='http://localhost:8000/docs/api-docs/' npm start


##### Legacy python back-end

To point this front-end to another (e.g. local test) back-end:
* Run `python manage.py runserver` from your back-end repo; this should start your back-end server on port 8000.
* Edit `app/app-init.js`, set `$rootScope.swaggerSpec = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs/api-docs/';`.

but, here are the instructions.

To deploy, just set a personal access token via GITHUB_TOKEN in your environment
and run the deploy script. The script will build your working directory as is,
and push it to Github pages.

    $ GITHUB_TOKEN=<your personal token> ./deploy.sh
